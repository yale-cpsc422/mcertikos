     * Initialization of the physical allocation table (AT).

     * In CertiKOS, all addresses < VM_USERLO or >= VM_USERHI are reserved by the kernel.
     * That corresponds to the physical pages from 0 to VM_USERLO_PI - 1,
     * and from VM_USERHI_PI to NUM_PAGES - 1.
     * The rest of the pages that correspond to addresses [VM_USERLO, VM_USERHI)
     * can be used freely ONLY IF the entire page falls into one of the ranges in
     * the memory map table with the permission marked as usable.
     *
     * Hint:
     * 1. You have to initialize AT for all the page indices from 0 to NPS - 1.
     * 2. For the pages that are reserved by the kernel, simply set its permission to 1.
     *    Recall that the setter at_set_perm also marks the page as unallocated.
     *    Thus, you don't have to call another function to set the allocation flag.
     * 3. For the rest of the pages, explore the memory map table to set its permission
     *    accordingly. The permission should be set to 2 only if there is a range
     *    containing the entire page that is marked as available in the memory map table.
     *    Otherwise, it should be set to 0. Note that the ranges in the memory map are
     *    not aligned by pages, so it may be possible that for some pages, only some of
     *    the addresses are in a usable range. Currently, we do not utilize partial pages,
     *    so in that case, you should consider those pages as unavailable.
